## EdgeCmd utility

The EdgeCmd utility enables adapter configuration on both Linux and Windows operating systems. For more information on using the EdgeCmd utility, see the [EdgeCmd utility documentation](https://docs.osisoft.com/bundle/edgecmd/page/index.html).

## REST tools

The following tools are available to make REST calls:

### curl

curl is a command line tool used to make HTTP calls and is supported on both Windows and Linux operating systems. You can script curl with Bash or PowerShell on Linux or Windows and you can use it to perform adapter administrative and programming tasks. `curl` commands are used in configuration and management examples throughout this document. For more information, see [curl (https://curl.haxx.se/)](https://curl.haxx.se/).

### Postman
